# Excell-Sheet-Web-App
Excell Sheet Web App is created using Vanilla JavaScript and SCSS. One of the cool feature it has is the cyclic dependecy tracker, if there is cycling dependecy between the cells then the popup appears on the screen asking you to track the cyclic dependent cells and lets you track by highlighting those cells.
